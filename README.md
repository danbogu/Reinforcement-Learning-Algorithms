# Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms
This project (in collaboration with Noa Menashe) is a solution for a Reinforcement Learning task for finding the optimal path
from an initial state to a goal state (in a deterministic environment and deterministic actions).
In this project, we created a value function matrix as well as  a state-value-function and a policy, that were trained by several 
classic RL algorithms such as Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, Q Learning, and SARSA.
All of the algorithms were trained in a stochastic environment.
They (excl. DP) also used an "Epsilon-decay" scheme and were tuned for different parameters to achieve optimal results.
